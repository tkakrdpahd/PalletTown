# Pallet Town

Pallet Town (マサラタウン) is the starting town in Pokémon. In South Korea, there is an internet meme that says, “Wow, it’s Pallet Town!”, which is often used to describe a feeling of returning to the very beginning.

The Pallet Town project is an attempt to return—using my current perspective—to the moment when I first encountered programming in elementary school, and to re-examine that starting point from where I am now.

This project repository was created almost two years ago. In other words, I was already struggling with similar questions back then, but for various reasons, I was unable to follow through and fully pursue them at the time.

To be honest, simply reading *The C Programming Language* by Kernighan and Ritchie and mechanically implementing its example code feels overly academic and, for me, ultimately unengaging.

Lately, I feel that I have lost my way.
