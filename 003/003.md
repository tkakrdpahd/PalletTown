# 003

From this point on, the basic topics of C quickly become unbearably dull.

So instead of going through formatted I/O, expressions, selection statements, loops, data types, arrays, functions, and program design one by one, we will mash all of them together and build *something* instead.

In **003**, we will implement a one-dimensional *Sandtris with CLI* using all core features of the C language, of course, references will still be used—and structure the program using a **function-driven development** design approach.
